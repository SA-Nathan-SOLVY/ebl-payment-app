2. **Long-term Wealth Building**: Guaranteed growth and family protection
3. **Community Empowerment**: Cooperative ownership and shared benefits
4. **Economic Independence**: Reduced dependence on traditional financial institutions

The user's successful IBC implementation demonstrates the viability and power of this approach. Scaling it to a cooperative model through MOLI could revolutionize how diaspora communities build and maintain wealth while honoring the legacy of economic self-determination championed by civil rights pioneers.

This concept aligns perfectly with the DECIDEY NGO mission and provides a concrete pathway for achieving the economic empowerment and community building goals outlined in the broader SOLVY ecosystem vision.
